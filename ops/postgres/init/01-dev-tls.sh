# DEV ONLY. Generates a self-signed TLS certificate for Postgres so the
# application's `ssl=require` connection works in the local compose stack.
#
# Why a self-signed cert in dev: asyncpg connects with ssl='require' (TLS with
# no peer verification, Backend.md §4.1), so no trust chain is needed — but
# Postgres will not enable ssl at all without a certificate. Production
# certificates come from the national CA via Docker secrets, never from here.
#
# Runs inside docker-entrypoint-initdb.d (before the server starts for the
# first time) and persists into PGDATA; subsequent starts reuse the files.

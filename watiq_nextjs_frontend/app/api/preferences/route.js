 *
 * The floating controls are a real form posting here, so they work with
 * JavaScript off — the whole point of the text-size control is that it reaches
 * people who are least likely to be on a current browser. The client script
 * intercepts the submit and applies the change in place; this is what happens
 * when it cannot.
 *
 * A year-long cookie rather than the session: the preference has to survive
 * signing out, and it is not a secret. httpOnly is deliberately false — the
 * client script reads it to keep the controls in sync.

 * Same relative-path rule as the sign-in `next`, but landing on the portal

 * an anonymous reader to a login screen for changing the text size would be a
 * strange answer to the request.
 *
 * The '//' check is the one that matters — '//evil.example' is a
 * protocol-relative URL, and a browser treats it as another origin.

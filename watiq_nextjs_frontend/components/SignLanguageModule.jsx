/**
 * The sign-language interpreter slot, rendered once from the root layout so
 * it floats over every screen.
 *
 * The design system mandates a reserved overlay slot for a TSL interpreter
 * feed across the primary citizen journeys. Screens scripted in
 * sign_language_videos_guide.pdf carry their own clip, resolved per request by
 * lib/tsl.js and passed in as `src`; every other screen still renders the
 * placeholder — a framed video region with the interpreter poster and an
 * explicit "coming soon" badge. Either way the full control set that
 * public/js/watiq.js ships actions for (a11y-play/-pause, -mute/-unmute,
 * -expand, -close) is present and bound.
 *
 * Wiring notes, so the panel keeps working as it evolves:
 *   - id="tsl-module" and class "SignLanguageModule" are load-bearing:
 *     watiq.js resolves controls through #tsl-module/.tsl-module selectors,
 *     and public/js/pages/error_maintenance.js greps for .SignLanguageModule.
 *   - Clips live in public/video/tsl/ and are chosen by route in lib/tsl.js.
 *     watiq.js resolves the media as panel.querySelector('video, audio'), so a
 *     filled src makes every control work with no change on its side.
 *   - preload="metadata" is deliberate: the panel is chrome on every screen,
 *     and only the citizen who opens it should pay for the download.
 *   - Bottom-end corner, mirroring A11yControls on the bottom-start corner;
 *     both carry logical (start/end) offsets so RTL flips them together.
